About this Hands-on Lab
In this hands-on lab, we will review the VPC configuration and understand the components required to provision EC2 instances, while identifying what makes an instance public vs. private. We will create an Amazon EC2 instance and a security group in the public and private subnet, validate connectivity using SSH, and identify what makes the instance and the subnet private.
